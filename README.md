# Remote Intern Management System
A full-stack CRUD web application for managing remote interns.  
Built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React.  
Deployed on AWS EC2 with CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

## Jira Board URL:
https://connect-team-k67zdr7i.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/RIMS/boards/34

## Project Setup Instructions
This project was set up by following the instruction of tutorial.

## 1. Clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajuiit/sdlapps.git
```
## GitHub Repository Setup
After cloning the starter project, the original remote was removed and replaced with a personal GitHub repository.

## 2. Install dependencies
Run the following command in the root folder to install both frontend and backend dependencies:
```bash
npm run install-all 
```

## 3. Configure environment variables
Create a .env file inside the backend/ folder, and copy the contents from .env.example.
Change the MongoDB connection string replace it with account, password and project name.

## 4. Start the project locally
Run the following command to start both the frontend and backend:
```bash
npm start
```
## Version Control Strategy
The project follows Git best practices:
- `main` branch for stable code
- Feature branches created and merged via pull requests
- Meaningful commit messages

## CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
This project uses GitHub Actions to automatically deploy both frontend and backend to an AWS EC2 instance.
- The workflow is triggered upon every push to the `main` branch.
- Deployment is performed via SSH using secure credentials stored in GitHub Secrets.
- The EC2 instance pulls the latest code from the repository, installs dependencies, and restarts the application using PM2.
- Both frontend and backend run on the same server and are accessible via the same public IP.
- All frontend interactions trigger backend API calls that update data stored in MongoDB Atlas in real time.

### Authentication
This project does not require login.  
All users can access and use the dashboard directly without authentication.













*Assignment brief excerpt included below*

**Assessment 1 (Total Marks **20**)**

Assignment: **Software requirements analysis and design (**Full-Stack CRUD Application Development with DevOps Practices**)**


---

**Objective**

You have been provided with a starter project that includes user authentication using Node.js, React.js, and MongoDB. Your task is to extend this application by implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations of different features for a real-world application of your choice, while following industry best practices such as: 

* **Project Management with JIRA**
* **Requirement Diagram**, **Block Definition Diagram (**BDD), Parametric Diagram using**SysML**
* **Version Control using GitHub**
* **CI/CD Integration for Automated Deployment**

**Requirement**

1. **Choose a Real-World Application**

We will send you an email to choose a Real-World project. If you face any difficulties in choosing your project, please contact your tutor.

2. **Project Design with SysML and Project Management with JIRA**

* Draw a requirements diagram, Block Definition Diagram (BDD), and Parametric Diagram based on your project (Connect all functional features).
* Create a JIRA project and define:
  * Epic
  * User Stories (features required in your app)
  * Child issues or Subtasks (breaking down development work)
  * Sprint Implementation (organizing work into milestones)
* Provide your JIRA board URL in the project README.

**3. Backend Development (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)**

* Set up and configure the MongoDB database connection.
* Implement various backend functions for handling application data.Ensure that all functions are compatible with an Application Programming Interface (API) structure(Follow existing patterns used in the Task Manager App where applicable).
* Implement CRUD operations forcreating, reading, updating, and deleting records for each functionality.

4. **Frontend Development (React.js)**

* Create a user-friendly interface to interact with your API endpoint (Follow task manager app).
* Implement different forms for adding, updating, and deleting records.
* Display data using tables, cards, or lists (Follow how we showed data in task manager app, try to implement better visualization for the frontend.)

**5. Authentication & Authorization** (Prerequisite Task)

* Ensure only authenticated users can access and perform CRUD operations. (Already developed in your project)
* Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication (Use the task manager one from .env file).

**6. GitHub Version Control & Branching Strategy**

* Use GitHub for version control and maintain:
* main branch (stable production-ready code)
* Feature branches for each new feature
* Follow proper commit messages and pull request (PR) for code reviews.

**7. CI/CD Pipeline Setup**

* Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to:
* Automatically run tests on every commit/pull request (Optional).
* Deploy the backend to AWS. (Use the QUT provided EC2 instance)
* Deploy the frontend to AWS.
* Document your CI/CD workflow in the README.

---

**Submission Requirements**

**A report **contains** the following (Provide screenshots as evidence for each implemented task. **The screenshot should **contain** your username** from JIRA, GITHUB, and AWS**):

* **JIRA Project **Management**(Provide screenshots in the **report o**f at least two epics**, **including user story, sub**t**a**sks**. **Please **donâ€™t** provide **the **U**ser Authentication** epic**.**Provide your JIRA Board URL in the report and README file as well.**Through the JIRA Board, we will systematically review the completeness of the project features, organised under Epics, User Stories, and Sub-tasks.**
* Requirement diagram, Block Definition Diagram (BDD), Parametric Diagram (Using project features).
* **GitHub Repository (backend/ and frontend/)** link. We will **review** your code implementation, which you followed from the task description. We will also **review** your commits, main branch, feature branches, and pull requests. **(**Please note that the authorisation** (Log In, Registration)** is the prerequisite for backend development.**)**
* CI/CD pipeline details step by step screenshot.
* README.md with:
* Project setup instructions.
* Public URL of your project.
* Provide a project-specific username and password if we need to access your dashboard.

**Assessment Criteria:**

* Clarity and completeness of Jira board and SysML models.
* Adherence to Git best practices and practical contributions.
* Successful implementation, deploymentand CI/CD pipeline.
* Problem-solving skills and the ability to go beyond basic requirements.
